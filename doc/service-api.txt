Service hierarchy
=================

Service		org.bluez
Interface	org.bluez.Service
Object path	[variable prefix]/{hci0,hci1,...}

Methods		uint32 AddRecord(string record)

			Adds a new service record from the XML description
			and returns the assigned record handle.

			Possible errors: org.bluez.Error.InvalidArguments
					 org.bluez.Error.Failed

		void UpdateRecord(uint32 handle, string record)

			Updates a given service record provided in the
			XML format.

			Possible errors: org.bluez.Error.InvalidArguments
					 org.bluez.Error.NotAvailable
					 org.bluez.Error.Failed

		void RemoveRecord(uint32 handle)

			Remove a service record identified by its handle.

			It is only possible to remove service records that
			where added by the current connection.

			Possible errors: org.bluez.Error.InvalidArguments
					 org.bluez.Error.NotAuthorized
					 org.bluez.Error.DoesNotExist
					 org.bluez.Error.Failed

		void Register(string uuid, dict settings,
					array{object} characteristics)

			Add a GATT based service. The uuid represents the
			primary/secondary service UUID. The settings
			dictionary has the following format:
			{
				"id": string (optional)
			}

			settings field is being added to allow API
			flexibility. The "id" field allows the core to
			manage handle allocation and internal GATT storage.

			GATT included services is supported by providing the
			same characteristic object path (restricted to same
			provider/owner).

			The characteristic objects implemented by the
			caller shall follow the interface defined in the
			attribute API.

			Possible errors: org.bluez.Error.InvalidArguments
					 org.bluez.Error.AlreadyExists

		void Unregister(string uuid)

			Removes a given GATT based service previously
			registered by the caller.

					 org.bluez.Error.NotAuthorized

		void RegisterWatcher(object agent, dict settings,
						array{object} characteristics)

			Register a watcher to monitor characteristic changes.

			A watcher will be registered for each specified
			characteristic object. The settings dictionary has the
			following format:

			{
				"raw": boolean (optional)
			}

			If the "raw" setting is enabled, the RawValueChanged()
			watcher method is called when the characteristic value
			changes, otherwise, ValueChanged() is called.

		void UnregisterWatcher(object agent)

			Unregister a characteristic watcher.

		void RequestAuthorization(string address, uint32 handle)

			Request an authorization for an incoming connection
			for a specific service record. The service record
			needs to be registered via AddRecord first.

			Possible errors: org.bluez.Error.InvalidArguments
					 org.bluez.Error.NotAuthorized
